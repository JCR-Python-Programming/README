Learn Python Programming with me.

These Python files are meant to be explored. Some examples show possible text errors that beginners should know and understand,
to be able to identify such errors from occurring.

Please note: any Python programming examples, which are not 'mine', I will sternly give credit those of whom I've used examples from,
such as Corey Schafer and Programming with Mosh.

99% of anything else is all my very own, dedicated Python programming skills and works, which so far had taken me six years to fully start to understand
Object Oriented Programming Languages, such as Python.

However, my "Python Programmer's Glossary Bible" By Joseph C. Richardson does not and will not contain any Python programming examples from others, unless others want to build onto it, knowingly first.

I sincerely hope you will want to learn as much Python programming skills, as I, myself am still learning all about Python, Object Oriented Programming.

Explore the Wonderful World of Robotics Programming.

If anyone has a Robomaster S1 from DJI, why not have some fun learning all about how to program it with me, as I am still very new to the Robomaster S1‚Äôs Python programming abilities. So far, all my Robomaster S1 Python program codes are just simple for now. You can learn how to program the LED‚Äôs, the blaster, the gimbal and the chassis.

So why not have some fun and learn to program the Robomaster S1 with me. I will keep adding more and more Robomaster S1 Python programming examples.

Please note: some of my Python files are in their experimental stages, such as my Tk calculator Python programs. As with all things we learn, we also have to learn to experiment with whatever we are learning first beforehand. I'm constantly learning Python programming every single day, and I have been doing such for almost seven years this Christmas day coming. I started to learn Object Oriented Programming back in 2017 on Christmas day. However, you are all more than welcome to explore all my Python programming experiments with me. I don't have anything worth protecting, I have no such software inventions I want to hide away from others, whatsoever; I'm just a simple Python programmer, who is constantly learning what this type of Object Oriented Programming is truly all about. I will keep on learning so I can keep on teaching and sharing all my Python code to EVERYONE, who wants to learn with me on GitHub.com, as well as on my YouTube channel.

Because, the more I can learn is the more fun we both can have.
